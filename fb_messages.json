This message is helped by the advising tone the author has, which gives the image of an experienced and very knowledgeable traveler.\tThis poem can apply to the journey Odysseus goes through in the Odyssey. Odysseus's journey is as line 3 says, \u201cfull of adventure, full of discovery\u201d. Odysseus's journey was a very long one filled with excitement and danger including, \u201cLaistrygonians, Cyclopes, angry Poseidon\u201d. Odysseus is able to be a part of events that most people could only dream of doing. He has adventures that others wouldn't dare to try. The life of a couch worm is an easy one, without worry or fear. Yet at the end of the day the couch worms would never experience the parts of life that Odysseus experienced. Odysseus connects to the author's theme because he is able to experience everything life can offer, comfort, peace, danger, and hardships, and thus leading a fulfilling life. Odysseus can also connect to the author's theme because he also remembers his roots, Ithaka. In the poem Ithaka, the author writes, \u201cKeep Ithaka always in your mind. Arriving there is what you're destined for\u201d. Odysseus's ultimate goal is to go home. Throughout all his journeys, he is thinking about his home and his family. An example of this is on Kalypso's island. Even though Odysseus has been there for 7 years, he thinks about his wife everyday. He never forgets his roots even though he is in the presence of a goddess. Odysseus not only leads a fulfilling life, but also never remembers where he came from, the Ithaka that \u201cgave you this marvelous journey\u201d.

In this case, after the substrate fits into the activation site, then the bonds of hydrogen peroxide is broken. This lowers the activation energy required to break the bond. After the bond is broken the substrate will spilt up into 2 H2O and O2 (see figure 1). The products are then released and the activation site once again is empty and open to accept new hydrogen peroxide molecules (note that this is a cycle).

Spread liberally throughout the story, weather imagery serves several important functions to provide deeper understanding of the text.   It may symbolize the emotional state of a character or give insight to their personality.  Weather descriptions foreshadow key events in the story and even provide clues to underlying character development.  By corresponding to feelings, events, and character development, weather imagery enhances the reader's understanding of the novel's characters and themes. One example of the relationship between weather and characters' feelings occurs as Gene is on his way to train for the Olympics with Finny.  Gene recalls, \u201cThe plain of snow shone a powdery white that morning; the sun blazed icily somewhere too low on the horizon to be seen directly, but its clean rays shed a blue-white glimmer all around us.  The northern sunshine seemed to pick up faint particles of whiteness floating in the air and powdering the sleek blue sky.  Nothing stirred\u201d (Knowles 119).  Gene is \u201cfed up with all this work, and from now on would only go rackingly through the motions\u201d (119).  The relative stillness of the weather scene parallels Gene's lack of interest in training, reflecting his own uninspired attitude.  As it is clear Gene detests his training, yet persists with it, questions of his motive emerge.  It can be inferred that Gene continues this training only for Finny.   Here weather is linked to Gene's emotional state as the complexities of the story unfold. Another example where weather and feelings are correlated occurs at the beach.  Gene reflects, \u201cHe rode backward with no hands, he rode on his own handlebars, he jumped off and back on his moving bike as he had seen trick horseback riders do in the movies.  He sang. The Boardwalk lights against the deepening blue sky gained an ideal, starry beauty and the lights from the belt of honky-tonks and shooting galleries and beer gardens gleamed with a quiet purity in the clear twilight (46-47).  During a beautiful day, Finny and Gene have a wonderful time at the beach.  Good weather is associated with good times in the contentment of their relationship.  The relationship between feelings of fun and excitement and beautiful weather and are emphasized.  Whether the feelings are of excitement or disinterest, weather parallels feelings, providing deeper understanding of the text.  Weather is also used to illuminate several character traits of Finny.  The winter is full of challenges, such as heavy snow, bitter cold, and slippery ice.  Finny's impulsive attraction to danger and challenges is reflected in his love for winter, a harsh and challenging season.  Finny says, \u201cWinter loves me, I mean as much as you can say a season can love.  What I mean is, I love winter, and when you really love something, then it loves you back, in whatever way it has to love\u201d (111).  The expectation of reciprocity in his relationship with winter is na\u00efve, and reflects Finny's immaturity .  Life isn't fair this way, as Gene suspects even at age seventeen.  Daring and exuberant, Finny embraces winter while innocently and possibly recklessly ignoring its dangers.", "because I really don't want to change my intro and conclusion again", "'ll upload the part and tell me if it actually doesn't work", "here I", "ugg I have to change a lot then", "which is better, more thorough but wrong format, or right format but less thorough?", "I cant combine the 2nd paragraph anywhere, so It won't fit her suggested format", "intropara1 - feelings (2 quotes)para 2 - charecter traits (1 quote)para 3 - foreshadow (2 quote)para 4 - charcecter developement (2 quotes)conclusion", "my second paragraph has only one idea and doesn't connect to anyother paragraphs, but its probably my strongest idea", "?", "can you have 4 body paragraphs", "wait for the antibiotics diagram are you doing group or class averages?", "but does matt want 2 diagrams", "i don't think hohn wants a table for the class substances", "did you make a diagram of you experient only or both", "you noob", "and page 1 on every page", "and you must write p1 english ", "yes you do.", "yes.", "of article", "ugg aparently use the title ", "utterly useless", "haha I wrote (no author, 2012) for litterally all of them", "grichevsky thinks so too", "right", "your not supposed to explain why in the hypthesis", "?", "is that specific enough", "A greater concentration of caffeine used  will result in a larger diameter of bacterial inhibition zone.", "so do we need table of group, table of class, and graph of class avr", "now to give to my dad who will say its crap and I'll be up to 10 editing it anyways", "I'm going to say that I'm done", "and yes", "I left mine out of it", "who?", "from josh x and kevin ma", "your dumb", "well...", "I should have written your a moron", "because you said every page was page one and that your in 1st period english", "noob", "and then whatever into the next one", "Ill just start off by saying it as its on paragraph", "I cant find a place to say that in the conclusion", "i guess", "so wouldn't something that kind of worked but was really low in viscosity work best in the test?", "ie none other than the disk", "so it would be the same for each", "wouldn't it only kill where the stuff touched it ", "why are some zones of inhibition bigger", "question", "?", "and thats better than the others", "and possibly intro", "remember if you say that cool aid will work the best than you have to explain why you thought that in the conclusion", "it says", "1-3", "and no matter what it wont be as big as antibiots", "I said higher concentrations bigger zone", "but I have 2", "no", "and to the antibiotics", "yes", "k", "because I might just not and say \"It's perfect.

Therefore it's safe to assume that it's already optimally Sorted in some way that transcends our na\u00efve mortal understanding of \"ascending order\". Any attempt to change that order to conform to our own preconceptions would actually make it less sorted.AnalysisThis algorithm is constant in time, and sorts the list in-place, requiring no additional memory at all.
